/**
 * ZSLRUQueueCache is a least recently used cache with user defined limits.
 *
 * This class must be initialized with the directory to be used for on-disk cache.  It
 * will assume that this directory is only being used for this cache.
 * 
 * You may set limits on the number of items to be stored in memory, and the size in
 * bytes that may be stored on disk.  In both instances, the least recently used items
 * will be ejected from the cache first.
 *
 * There are also options to dynamically reduce the in-memory limits when low memory
 * conditions are encountered.
 *
 * Cached objects must implement the NSCoding protocol in order to be written to disk.
